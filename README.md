# 📊 Amazon Sales Performance Analysis  

## 📝 Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data from Amazon to extract insights that can help improve product performance, understand customer behavior, and drive data-informed business decisions. Using Python and data analysis libraries, the project explores patterns in product ratings, revenue, and sales trends.

---

## 🎯 Objective
*To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Amazon product sales.*

*To identify top-performing products and categories.*

*To understand the relationship between ratings, reviews, and sales.*

*To draw actionable insights for business growth.*

## 🗂️ Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following fields (based on EDA sections):
- *Product ID*
- *Product Title*
- *Category*
- *Selling Price*
- *MRP*
- *Discount*
- *Number of Ratings*
- *Number of Reviews*
- *Rating*
- *Revenue*
- *Units Sold*

## 🔧 Tools and Libraries Used
*Python*

*Jupyter Notebook*

*Pandas*

*NumPy*

*Matplotlib*

*Seaborn*

## 📈 Key Analysis Performed
*Data Cleaning & Preprocessing*

*Descriptive Statistics*

*Correlation Analysis*

*Revenue and Rating Distribution*

*Top Products by Revenue and Ratings*

*Category Performance Comparison*

*Insights and Business Recommendations*

## 💡 Insights & Findings
- *Asian-Pac-Islander is the race with the highest education coverng about (22.5%) of the entire population*
- *Married-civ-spouse is the marital status with the highest number of spouse (9,851) earning >50K*
- *Adm-clerical is the top occupation done by women. with a total number of (3,750) women in this occupation*
- *Exec-managerial Occupation, is the occupation that has the highest number of people (2,896) earning >50k.*
- *Individuals that work more hours tend to earn >50k. This implies that the hours worked, has an impact on the amount earned.*

## ✅ Model Performance and Recommendations:

- *A Logistic Regression model was trained and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix.*

- *The model achieved reasonable accuracy, but precision and recall could likely be improved with better feature engineering (e.g., combining rare categories).*

- *Confusion matrix showed that while the model distinguishes between classes, there is room for better performance, especially for minority class detection.*
